<br/>
By day I work with a team of skilled artists, mashing together platforms, environments, and languages like MATLAB, Blender, CUDA, Python, and more. On occasion I hamfist my way through design work.

By night I develop games! Mostly browser-based, and mostly involving meticulous reinvention of the wheel.. Every so often I dabble in such things as three.js and Unity.
