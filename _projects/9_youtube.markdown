Inspired by <i>3Blue1Brown</i>'s <a href="https://3blue1brown.com/blog/some1">Summer of Math Exposition</a>, I kicked off a Youtube channel to share my learnings on orbital dynamics and perhaps more.

Check out my first video, covering parts 1 and 2 of a 4 part series describing Keplerian orbital elements, the Kepler Equation, and building computational models to solve the 2-body problem.
